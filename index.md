This is the new homepage for Plattsburgh Software Developers.  The goal is to help area developers connect.  Burlington currently has a strong developer community with user groups like vtdotnet.org and vtrails.org amongst others.  Up until now, Plattsburgh had nothing.

If we get enough people to join, perhaps we can have meetups to see what others around the area are doing.
